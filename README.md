# CS51_Final
Repo for CS51 Final Project
Before you can compile and run this project, you will need to download the Pygame library for Python.  Specific instructions can be found at http://pygame.org/wiki/macintosh for Mac users and http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml for Windows users.
Once you have downloaded and installed Pygame, you can compile and execute Mazerunner.  In order to compile and run this project, simply navigate to the "code" folder in the terminal.  Execute "python mazegraphics.py" to run the program.
You control the blue circle with the arrow keys.  Navigate the maze, avoiding the enemies, and making sure not to hit the walls.  The red tile is the exit, and once you reach it you will be taken to the next level. Can you beat all 5 levels?
