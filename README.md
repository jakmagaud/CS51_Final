# CS51_Final
Repo for CS51 Final Project
In order to compile and run this project, simply navigate to the "code" folder in the terminal.  Execute "python mazegraphics.py" to run the program.
You control the blue circle with the arrow keys.  Navigate the maze, avoiding the enemies, and making sure not to hit the walls.  The red tile is the exit, and once you reach it you will be taken to the next level. Can you beat all 5 levels?
